# TonotopyCNN â€” Neuroscience-Inspired Audio Classification

This project explores **neuroscience-inspired convolutional networks** for sound classification using the **ESC-50 dataset**.
It compares a standard baseline CNN with a **tonotopic / Gabor-initialized CNN** that mimics the **frequency-selective organization of the auditory cortex**.
